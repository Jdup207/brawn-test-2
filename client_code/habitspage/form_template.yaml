        1. Make a plan to eat a variety of fruits and vegetables daily. The goal is to eat at least five servings per day, and include varieties of fruit and vegetable color. One serving is approximately the size of a baseball. Fruits and vegetables are filled with the energy and nutrients necessary for training and recovery. Plus, these antioxidant-rich foods will help you combat illness like a cold or the flu.

        2. Choose whole grain carbohydrates sources such as whole-wheat bread or pasta and fiber-rich cereals as power-packed energy sources. Limit the refined grains and sugars such as sugary cereals, white breads and bagels. You'll benefit more from whole-grain products.
        Choose healthy sources of protein such as chicken, turkey, fish, peanut butter, eggs, nuts and legumes.

        3. Stay hydrated with beverages, as a 2% drop in hydration levels can negatively impact performance. Options include milk, water, 100% fruit juice and sport drinks. However, realize that sport drinks and 100% fruit juice tend to be higher in overall sugar content and, in the case of fruit juice, lack many of the health benefits present in its whole food counterpart. Also, be sure not to confuse sports drinks such as Gatorade with "energy" drinks such as Red Bull and similar beverages.

        4. Stick with whole food options as much as possible as opposed to highly processed foods.

        Adequate hydration is a key element in sports performance. Most athletes benefit from developing a personal hydration plan. A general rule for training is to consume a minimum:

        - Two cups of fluid prior to training
        - Four to six ounces of fluid every 15 minutes of exercise

        Your post event/training hydration needs are impacted by your overall pre- to post-fluid losses. To properly assess, weigh yourself immediately prior to and after a workout. For every pound of weight lost, replace with 16 ounces of fluid. Best hydration choices include water, low-fat milk or 100% juice. Sports beverages are best reserved for competition, where quick hydration and electrolyte replacement are necessary.

        There are a few golden rules when it comes to eating on game day:

        - Remember, proper nutrition for the "big tournament/race/meet" does not happen on the day of the event alone. It happens the days, weeks and months leading up to the competition

        - Never experiment with a new dietary/supplement protocol on game day. First, try it out prior to a practice/training session to make sure you tolerate it well.

        - As you get closer to the game/competition, make your meals smaller. Additionally, you may want to limit dairy, fat and fibrous carbohydrate sources during the last 60 to 90 minutes pre-event/practice, as these can cause GI issues.
