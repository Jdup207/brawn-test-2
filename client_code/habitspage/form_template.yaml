Healthy sources of fat include nuts, nut butters, avocados, olive and coconut oils. Limit use of vegetable oils such as corn, cottonseed or soybean oil. \n\nDietary protein plays a key role in muscle repair and growth. Preferred sources of protein include lean meats, eggs, dairy (yogurt, milk, cottage cheese) and legumes."

        1. Make a plan to eat a variety of fruits and vegetables daily. The goal is to eat at least five servings per day, and include varieties of fruit and vegetable color. One serving is approximately the size of a baseball. Fruits and vegetables are filled with the energy and nutrients necessary for training and recovery. Plus, these antioxidant-rich foods will help you combat illness like a cold or the flu.

        2. Choose whole grain carbohydrates sources such as whole-wheat bread or pasta and fiber-rich cereals as power-packed energy sources. Limit the refined grains and sugars such as sugary cereals, white breads and bagels. You'll benefit more from whole-grain products.
        Choose healthy sources of protein such as chicken, turkey, fish, peanut butter, eggs, nuts and legumes.

        3. Stay hydrated with beverages, as a 2% drop in hydration levels can negatively impact performance. Options include milk, water, 100% fruit juice and sport drinks. However, realize that sport drinks and 100% fruit juice tend to be higher in overall sugar content and, in the case of fruit juice, lack many of the health benefits present in its whole food counterpart. Also, be sure not to confuse sports drinks such as Gatorade with "energy" drinks such as Red Bull and similar beverages.

        4. Stick with whole food options as much as possible as opposed to highly processed foods.
